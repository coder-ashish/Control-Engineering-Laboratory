## Procedure
⦁	To calculate the transfer function for the desired electric network, the user should select the series or parallel electric network from the dropdown box.\
⦁	For the calculation of current in the selected circuit the user would provide the values of resister, inductor and capacitor.\
⦁   For the calculation of voltage in the selected circuit the user would provide the values of resister, inductor and capacitor.\
⦁	For the calculation of transfer function and time response for the series or parallel network, the user would provide calculated voltage and current.
