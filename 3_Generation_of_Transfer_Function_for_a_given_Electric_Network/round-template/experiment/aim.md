## AIM:
To obtain the Transfer Function of series and parallel RLC Network.

The user interacts with the virtual lab through the web page which contains the necessary electric network needed for calculations. The user is intended to have a thorough knowledge on the equations required for analyzing the transfer function and time response of the selected electric circuit. It is also mandatory for the user to apply those equations for the given system parameters and enter the same for verifying. The result of the calculation would be the current, voltage and transfer function of the series and parallel RLC network. User may also use the help option to have a better clarity on the doubts that arise during the conduction of experiments. Once after deriving the transfer function for the selected electric network by changing the parameters values such as resistor inductor and capacitor, the user would understand the change in voltage and current for the particular network. Also, how the response is different for change in parameters values of the network can also know to the user. Thus the user can able to study the behavior of the system with passive elements in the network.
