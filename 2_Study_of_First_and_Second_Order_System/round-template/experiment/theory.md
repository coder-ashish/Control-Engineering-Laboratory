## Theory
The standard first and second order systems are considered in this experiment. The different standard test signals such as impulse, step, ramp and parabolic signals are applied one by one to determine the time response of the first and second order system. Students will manually derive the time responses for the standard first and second order systems by applying test signals one by one and verify the same in virtual lab and also obtain the responses graphically to analyse the transient and steady state response of the system.  
The problem statement starts with obtain the response and analyze the transient and steady state response of the system. In that various standard signals are such as impulse, step, ramp and parabolic signals are used to calculated time response of the first and second system, we have use general formulas to calculate the same. Various responses are plotted to analyze the transient and steady state response of the system.
