# AIM:
To study of First and Second Order System.

The user interacts with the virtual lab through the web page which contains the necessary transfer function needed for calculations. The user is intended to have a thorough knowledge on the equations required for analyzing the time domain specifications. It is also mandatory for the user to apply those equations for the given system parameters and enter the same for verifying. The result of the calculation would be the time domain specifications of the first and second order system. User may also use the help option to have a better clarity on the doubts that arise during the conduction of experiments. Once after completing the entire time domain analysis for both first and second order system, the user would understand the transition of voltage or current from one steady state to another. Also, how the response is different for first and second order system can also be knowing to the user. Thus the user can able to study the behavior of the system with storage elements like inductor and capacitors.
