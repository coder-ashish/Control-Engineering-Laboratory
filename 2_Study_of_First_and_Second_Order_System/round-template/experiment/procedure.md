## Procedure
1.	For the selection of order of system, the user should select the first order or second order system from the available options. 
2.	For the calculation time response of first and second order system, the user should use standard test signals such as impulse, step, ramp and parabolic signals and are applied one by one.
3.	For the calculation time response of first and second order system, the user would provide general formula to calculate the same & it is verified with virtual calculation.
4.	To obtain the response and analyze the transient and steady state response of the system, the user should use time response of the system.
