            <h2>Aim</h3>
                <p class="para">The user interacts with the virtual lab through the web page which contains the necessary transfer function needed for calculations. The user is intended to have a thorough knowledge on the equations required for analyzing the time domain specifications. It is also mandatory for the user to apply those equations for the given system parameters and enter the same for verifying. The result of the calculation would be the time domain specifications of the first and second order system. User may also use the help option to have a better clarity on the doubts that arise during the conduction of experiments. Once after completing the entire time domain analysis for both first and second order system, the user would understand the transition of voltage or current from one steady state to another. Also, how the response is different for first and second order system can also be knowing to the user. Thus the user can able to study the behavior of the system with storage elements like inductor and capacitors.</p>

                <h2>Theory</h2>
                <p class="para">The standard first and second order systems are considered in this experiment. The different standard test signals such as impulse, step, ramp and parabolic signals are applied one by one to determine the time response of the first and second order system. Students will manually derive the time responses for the standard first and second order systems by applying test signals one by one and verify the same in virtual lab and also obtain the responses graphically to analyse the transient and steady state response of the system.  
The problem statement starts with obtain the response and analyze the transient and steady state response of the system. In that various standard signals are such as impulse, step, ramp and parabolic signals are used to calculated time response of the first and second system, we have use general formulas to calculate the same. Various responses are plotted to analyze the transient and steady state response of the system.
