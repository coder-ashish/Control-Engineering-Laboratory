<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

Design of PID Controller for first and second order System

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>
Tuning of PID controller using Ziegler Nichols method is obtained in this experiment. The given open loop system step response is derived in virtual lab. The delay time and time constants for step response is derived from the step response. The PID controller is tuned to a given system to obtain the time response such as steady state error, transient response of the closed loop system. The students able to analyse the system time domain specifications for the closed loop system by deriving the step response of the system before and after the controller is added to the system. It also provides the knowledge about the increase of poles and zeros to the system when controller is added to the system.  

<h5> Target Audience : </h5>
